# Note-Taker-with-Express.js

## Description
The goal of this assignment was to create the back-end Javascript using `node.js` and `express.js` to communicate with the already created UI. The finished product is an app that allows the user to create notes/reminders, and then those notes are saved in `db.json` & rendered on the screen. The final application has been deployed to heroku: https://fathomless-crag-06812.herokuapp.com.
